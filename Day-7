Conditionals
1) These are used when you need to do something depending on whether
or not a condition is satisfied.
2) We use if, elif, else keywords are used to implement the conditionals in
python.
3) Syntax:
if condition1:
statements-to-execute when condition1 is satisfied
elif condition2:
statements-to-execute when condition1 is not satisfied & condition2 is satisfied
else:
statements-to-execute when none of the conditions are satisfied
4) After every : we are giving space, this is called indentation. Indentation
is used to make sure that all required statements that are to be
executed when condition is satisfied are grouped.
5) Note: Irrespective of the condition being satisfied or not, the code
outside the indentation will always be executed.

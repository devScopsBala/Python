Variables:
-----------------------
1) Data is crucial part of every program, because data is something that is both
input & output for a program.

2) Many times, it is required to store this data in the program temporarily. For this
purpose, we create variables.

3) Variables are just containers to store data & variable names are just labels to
those containers.

4) There are certain rules to name a variable -
a) Starts with underscore( _ ) and letters only. (Letters include a,b,c,...z and
A,B,C,...Z)
b) Contains only letters, numbers and underscore
5) We can store data in any variable using equals sign ( = )

DataTypes
1) All data elements need containers i.e. variables to be stored but the type of
those containers can be very different due to the kind of data that is being
stored.
2) Following are the types of data based on various properties -
a) Numeric
i) Integer: To store integers Eg: 25,-6,64
ii) Float: To store numbers with decimal Eg: 3.14,9.7
iii) Complex: To store numbers with real and imaginary part Eg: 4+3j
b) Boolean: To store result of expressions with results in either True or False
c) Sequential
i) Strings
ii) Tuples
iii) Lists
d) Sets
e) Dictionaries
3) We will discuss Sequential, Sets, Dictionaries in further days to come. Stay
tuned...

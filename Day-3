Type casting
1) Type casting means type conversion
2) There are two types of type casting -
a) Implicit type casting - happens directly without our intervention
i) Eg: a = 3 Here, a is automatically made into an int by assigning 3
into it.

b) Explicit type casting - requires our intervention
i) Eg: b = 3.14
ii) c = int(b) Here, c is made into int forcefully and 0.14 data is
discarded which makes c = 3

Comments
1) Comments are used mainly in two cases -
a) To avoid a line of code from running/executing
b) To avoid description of a code from being treated as code and
executed.

2) There are two types of comments -
a) Single line comments ( # )
i) Eg: #a = 3
b) Multi line comments ( “”” “”” )
i) Eg: “”” a = 3
b = 6
